## Classic Amador Zinfandel

Fair warning: Cooper Vineyards is my absolute favorite all-around winery. They've been our 
longest-running wine club, and I consider their family and workers close friends of ours. 
Known particularly for their legendary Barbera grapes, Cooper also has many acres of Zinfandel 
vines right on their main estate. This vintage is one of those estate releases, showcasing the 
local terroir as well as the skills of both founder Dick Cooper and winemaker Mike Roser.

The nose evokes deep, dark blackberry paired with pepper spice, balancing the two notes nicely. 
On the medium-bodied palate, the fruit takes a backseat to the pepper as nice tannins come into 
the picture. The medium finish lets the tannins soften and stretch out the spice.

The tannins add nice depth and complexity to this vintage without being overpowering. This is a 
classic example of Amador County Zinfandel, wonderful from start to finish. The vintage is 
perfect on its own or paired with a nice meal, and there's no doubt why Cooper is one of the 
most respected wineries in the region!
