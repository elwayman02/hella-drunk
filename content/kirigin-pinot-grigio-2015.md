## A Bitter, But Light Experience

Kirigan Cellars is a Jack-Of-All-Trades when it comes to wine. They produce a bottle of almost 
every common varietal in California, and they do so with decent value. I'm a big fan of this 
approach, as it means they have a bit of something for everyone. That said, let's see how their 
Pinot Grigio fares.

The nose is extremely light, with a light acidic tang. The palate has a light to medium body, 
with that acidic nature turning to slightly bitter notes like the rind of a tart lemon or an 
underripe strawberry. Some bitterness evaporates on the back half of the short finish, 
leaving behind a cleaner feeling reminiscent of fresh lemon water.

There is a little complexity to this wine in the balance of the citrus, but there aren't many 
standout notes. The straightforward experience lack a unique touch as well, but it's certainly 
not a bad wine. This everyday vintage could go well paired with the right food, but it's not 
high on my list for special occasions.
