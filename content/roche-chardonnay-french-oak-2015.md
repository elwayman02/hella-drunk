## Crisp, Clean Chardonnay

You already know how much I love Roche Chardonnay. They make three reserves from their 
Carneros vineyards, and last time we tried the American Oak. The Stainless Steel provides a 
look at the unoaked experience, but this one is uses French Oak. While the American Oak 
imparted a buttery palate and creamy texture, changing to another kind of barrel completely 
changes the wine.

The nose evokes grapefruit and lemon, a beautiful citrus bouquet. On the palate, the medium 
body and acidity brings a nice tartness, blending that citrus flavor with a tiny bit of 
crisp granny smith apple. The medium finish is very clean, letting the tart apple fade out 
slowly as you relish the experience.

This gorgeous blend of flavors flows from one note to the next seamlessly, allowing for a 
surprising amount of complexity without confusing the mouth. Citrus and apple are fairly 
common in Chardonnays, so the uniqueness of this wine comes from how cleanly that French 
oak aging imparts flavors into the release. Beautiful on its own, this bottle is even better 
paired with a nice meal, perhaps seafood with citrus flavors. I would never turn down a glass 
or even an entire bottle!
