## A Creamy, Buttery Creation

I'll start off by admitting that Roche is one of my all-time favorite wineries. We were members 
of their wine club for several years, and a significant chunk of our cellar is devoted to their 
wines, so you can be sure we'll be seeing them on Hella Drunk again in the future. Roche 
specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, the former being one of my favorite varietals. I was 
never much of a white wine fan, but Roche is doing something right with their releases.

The nose starts with crisp pear but quickly turns buttery, bringing out a more savory essence. 
The palate is buttery with a full-bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel and medium acidity, bringing 
in the taste of the American Oak as well. The finish is short but clean as the acidity follows 
through to the end for a crisp, almost citrus-like conclusion.

The American oak aging adds a nice complexity to this release. I've tasted their stainless steel 
and French oak reserve from the same grapes, and the experience is totally different. This, of 
course, makes it a somewhat more unique release as well, though buttery Chardonnays are not 
unheard of. Overall, this is one of my favorite everyday drinking white wines, and I will always 
keep a few bottles of Roche Chardonnay in my cellar!
