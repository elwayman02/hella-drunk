## A Creamy, Buttery Creation

I'll start off by admitting that Roche is one of my all-time favorite wineries. We were members 
of their wine club for several years, and a significant chunk of our cellar is devoted to their 
wines, so you can be sure we'll be seeing them on Hella Drunk again in the future. Roche 
specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, the former being one of my favorite varietals. I was 
never much of a white wine fan, but Roche is doing something right with their releases.

The nose starts with crisp pear but quickly turns buttery, bringing out a more savory essence. 
The palate is buttery with a full-bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel and medium acidity, bringing 
in the taste of the American Oak as well. The finish starts with a short, clean burst as the 
acidity follows through to the end for a crisp, almost citrus-like feel. However, it gives way 
to a lingering, but mild tannic sensation that nicely contrasts the crispness that fades away 
before it.

The American oak aging adds a nice complexity to this release. I've tasted their stainless steel 
and French oak reserve from the same grapes, and the experience is totally different. This, of 
course, makes it a somewhat more unique release as well, though buttery Chardonnays are certainly 
not unheard of. Overall, this is one of my favorite everyday drinking white wines, and I will 
always keep a few bottles of Roche Chardonnay in my cellar!
