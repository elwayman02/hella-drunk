# Enhanced Information

A major focus we have here at Hella Drunk is giving you access to concise information without too much 
fluff or fanfare. We're not interested in drawing out our review content with extraneous prose and 
overly detailed stories. You're here to find out what we're drinking, what we taste in it, and how we'd 
rate it. Anything else is a distraction!

That's why we developed the Hella Drunk Rating to distill our tasting notes into a numerical format, 
and today we're adding even more enhancements to the site. Now, all past and future reviews will include 
a "Release Info" card, just like the one you see at the top of this post. We'll distill all the 
important information about the bottle we're drinking here: where it came from, what's in it, and 
everything else you need to know.

For now, this new info card has been finely tuned for the details of whiskey releases, since that's 
the main content we've put out thus far. However, you can be assured that as we expand and review other 
spirits, we'll be ensuring this card evolves to give you information relevant to each type of spirit we 
cover.

By putting this right at the top of every post, you don't have to read through paragraphs of information 
just to understand the specifics of what we're drinking. This lets us cut right to the chase and focus 
our writing on the tasting itself, with just a short introduction. At Hella Drunk, we'll always endeavor 
to provide you with the right information you're looking for, as efficiently and concisely as possible!
