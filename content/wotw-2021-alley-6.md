Hailing from Sonoma County, Alley 6 continues our run of local craft distilleries 
attending this year's [Whiskies of the World San Francisco](/whiskies-of-the-world-2021). 
While their product range includes gin and liqueurs as well, the booth this year 
focused primarily on the event's featured spirit. How did their pours stack up at 
our tastings? Let's find out.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdalley6ryetws" target="blank">Alley 6 Rye</a>

Aged in new American White Oak barrels with a heavy char, this whiskey has a 
mashbill of 78% rye and 22% malted barley. The nose is strongly reminiscent of a 
sour beer, a note that continues onto the palate, almost bringing a hoppy essence 
into play. The finish is extremely short, with just a bit of spice.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdalley6smtws" target="blank">Alley 6 Single Malt</a>

Taking it to another level, Alley 6's Single Malt is 100% German malted barley aged 
at least 18 months in the same kind of barrels used for their rye whiskey. The nose 
is full of sweetness and caramel with a medium ethanol level. The palate is brief 
with more caramel flavors before giving way to a short, spicy finish.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdalley6applebrandy" target="blank">Alley 6 Apple Brandy</a>

With a blend of locally-sourced apples and ones from Washington orchards, their Apple 
Brandy is aged in French and American Oak for 2 years. The nose is warm, evoking thoughts 
of pie and Braeburn apples. The palate doesn't have a ton of depth, with a light mouthfeel 
keeping the flavors delicate. The finish itself is short, without much added on in the end.

Alley 6 has been around just shy of a decade, and their products definitely felt a bit young 
in our tastings. The one that showed the most promise for me was the Apple Brandy, which 
smelled amazing but seems to need a few more years in the barrel to develop more complex 
flavors. We look forward to revisiting this distillery as their products mature and evolve!
