## Gorgeous, Balanced Red

While Vintner Jeff Runquist and his eponymous winery are located in Amador County within the 
California Shenandoah Valley AVA, this deep, dark red comes from Three Way Vineyard in Paso 
Robles. I have been a fan of their wines for a number of years, and this wine is no exception!

Sweetness on the nose is reminiscent of prunes, but with undertones that evoke balsamic vinegar. 
The palate is full-bodied and fruit-forward, tasting of blackberry with light, beautiful spice 
underneath. The finish is long and full of soft, structured tannins, allowing the wine to savor 
on the tongue afterward.

The complex flavors are gorgeously balanced, with no one element overpowering the rest. The 
craftsmanship of this vintage shows in the bold flavors that somehow manage to be soft at the 
same time. Jeff Runquist has outdone himself with this beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon!
