# Smooth But Lacking

Akashi, a blended Japanese whisky, comes from a distillery with very limited output, only being in 
operation a couple months each year. The bottle I'm tasting is the import available in the United States, 
which is different in formulation from the domestic release available in Japan. While the domestic release 
incorporates something called "molasses spirit", the international release uses imported grain whiskey 
instead.

The nose has a mild sweetness that gives way to a light campfire smell. The lack of ethanol is pleasant, 
but overall the nose doesn't have much substance. The palate turns that sweetness into something almost 
reminiscent of bubblegum and honey, while the wood begins to come in just a tad to cut through that 
taste. The finish is short, almost bitter, without much else going on.

The blend is straight-forward, focused on bringing a single consistent note throughout without any 
complexities. There's nothing too unique about it either, as it doesn't have much character of its own. 
Overall, this could be a pleasant sip with food or as a highball, but I wouldn't turn to it for a special 
pour.
