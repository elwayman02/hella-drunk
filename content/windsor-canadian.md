# Not Canada's Best

Windsor Canadian is a blended whisky owned by Prestige Beverage Group, having recently purchased the 
brand from Beam Suntory in December 2020. The 1.75 liter bottle I have was purchased several years ago 
under the former owners. While I can't find much information about the mashbill, rye is likely to feature 
prominently due to its production by Alberta Distillers Limited, who specialize in supplying rye whiskies 
to renowned brands such as WhistlePig, Lock Stock & Barrel, Jefferson's, and more.

The nose is sickly sweet and high on ethanol, though some caramel and a hint of orange come through 
underneath. The palate is surprisingly smooth, with the sweetness carrying through flavors of toffee 
and vanilla over only the barest traces of the barrel itself. The finish is short, but I wish it was 
shorter, as the burn comes in late and mixes poorly with the sickly flavors.

Windsor Canadian is mostly a one-note whisky, with the only complexity coming from the mild undertones 
of the barrel peeking through the palate. There's not much unique to it either, as you can find any 
number of similarly ethanol-forward whiskies at your local liquor store. I might have thought this 
was a great cheap option for mixed drinks in college, but there's a reason the latest bottle at our 
house is still nearly full.
