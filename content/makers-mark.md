# The First Whiskey I Ever Loved

Before we dive into this review, I have a confession to make. Maker's Mark holds dear memories for me 
as the first whiskey I ever grew to love. It was introduced to me by my brother-in-law when I first 
started drinking, and I credit that experience with growing a taste for finer spirits. In fact, I've 
been an ambassador for Maker's Mark since 2010:

So, while I will strive to be fair in my rating, I also want to be transparent about my love for Maker's. 
It's also my birthday today, so I can think of nothing better to celebrate than the taste of a personally 
beloved bourbon. It may no longer be the absolute best whiskey I've ever tasted, but it will always be a 
house favorite. With that disclaimer out of the way, however, let's get down to the tasting!

The nose kicks in strong with heavy notes of vanilla, caramel, and spice over just a hint of ethanol. 
The palate brings in a beautiful oak flavor with the spice continuing throughout. The long finish burns 
refreshingly on the tongue, with a hint of that vanilla resurfacing at the end.

While Maker's Mark has a bold, forward experience, there is some decent complexity waiting under the 
surface. While still somewhat of a classic flavor profile, Maker's Mark has always been a little unique 
as a wheated bourbon utilizing red winter wheat in its mashbill. This is a whiskey I will always have a 
bottle of at home, and I'll never turn down a dram of it anywhere else!
