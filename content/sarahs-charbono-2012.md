## A Well-Balanced, Intriguing Food Wine

Hailing from the so-called "garlic capital of the world", Gilroy, California, Sarah's Vineyard 
focuses on an entirely different profile. While most people would think of regions like Napa, 
Sonoma or Paso Robles when talking about California wine, this winemaker sits among many other 
fantastic producers nestled at the foot of the Santa Cruz Mountains. This particular bottle 
hails from the Santa Clara Valley, coming from one of their partner growers before they began 
using their own estate vines for this varietal in 2018.

The nose is boldly fruit-forward, with deep notes of black cherry and plum. These flavors 
come through nicely on the palate, with soft tannins emerging underneath the fruit. The fruitiness 
finally yields to those tannins on the medium-length finish, cleansing the palate nicely for the 
next sip.

The perfect balance between the fruit and tannins makes for a nice complexity in this extremely 
approachable wine. While there's nothing that particularly jumps out as unique about this particular 
Charbono, it does a great job of establishing why the varietal is so well-known as a great food wine. 
The way the finish cleans up after itself makes it pair well with just about any meal. It's a 
delightful wine that anyone can enjoy!
