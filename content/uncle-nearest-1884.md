# An Impressive Newcomer

Uncle Nearest 1884 Small Batch is one of three whiskies offered by this brand established in Summer 2017. 
This particular bottle is one of a series of blends curated by Master Blender Victoria Eady Butler,
descendent of their namesake, "Uncle" Nearest Green, from barrels hand-picked by the company's CEO Fawn 
Weaver. Not much is known about what goes into the blend, though my research indicates the mashbill is at 
least 51% corn.

The nose has nice caramel and vanilla over oak, with just a hint of ethanol sticking around in the glass. 
The palate reinforces this experience nicely, with all three notes coming through confidently and with 
great balance. Spice kicks in during the medium-length finish, lingering on top of a pleasant burn.

What it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in perfect balance, though they've clearly gone for nailing 
a classic experience over something more unique. The overall package turns Uncle Nearest 1884 into an 
instant classic despite its newcomer status, delivering a bourbon-esque style without the label. This 
easy-drinking Tennessee whiskey is something I would gladly quaff any day, without a doubt.
