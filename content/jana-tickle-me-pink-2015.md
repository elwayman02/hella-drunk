# A Delightfully Easy Drinker

An imprint of Amador County's Scott Harvey Wines, Jana Winery produces an interesting variety 
of wines using both local and Napa Valley vineyards. The Tickle Me Pink label is an annual vintage 
Rose blend often featuring Pinot Gris, Muscat Canelli, and Rose as its primary varietals, alongside 
smaller percentages of grapes like Concord and Syrah.

The nose on the 2015 seems to be an enticing mix of tart green apple and unripened pear, with a hint
of citrus in the background. On the palate, light carbonation leaps off the tongue before diving into 
notes of strawberry, cherry, and even a bit of apple cider. While deliciously sweet, it still has a 
balanced off-dry feel to it. The medium-short finish is slightly bitter like lemon zest.

The complexity of flavors made it difficult to pin down what I was tasting, but in the most delightful 
way. The flavor profile is so well blended that it takes on an experience of its own. This lends itself 
well to the uniqueness of the bottle; while I wouldn't call myself an expert on rose wines, I haven't 
experienced too many quite like this. It's a wine you just can't quite put down!
