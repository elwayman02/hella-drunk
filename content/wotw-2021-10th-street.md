10th Street came to [Whiskies of the World San Francisco](/whiskies-of-the-world-2021) 
as one of the few local distilleries, located nearby in San Jose. They had four whiskies 
available for us to try, though we'll only be covering two here. One of them, the delicious
<a href="https://bit.ly/hd10thpeatedwinetws" target="_blank">Peated Wine Cask</a>, was 
featured in the blind tasting for the [Dram Club](/wotw-2021-dram-club) event. Let's take 
a closer look at two more bottles from 10th Street Distillery!

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hd10thsinglemalttw" target="blank">10th Street Single Malt</a>

This bottle started with chocolate on the nose, complemented by a nice smoky scent as well. 
In a contrasting experience, my companion Bob got woodsy, fruity scents from this dram. The 
palate took me back to my Midwestern roots, evoking thoughts of steak and corn on the cob, 
whereas Bob felt it had more of a dark caramel essence. The medium-short finish had a nice 
spice to it, rounding out a whiskey that was a bit of an enigma for us (but still delightful).

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hd10thcalitws" target="blank">10th Street California Coast</a>

The nose on this one was light and airy, a mix of lemon citrus and sea breeze. The light 
mouthfeel on the palate was citrus-forward, leaning into that lemon essence. The finish 
was medium-short with a light amount of spice. Overall, this dram was very smooth, certainly 
an easy drinker.

While we wish we'd had time to try more whiskies from 10th Street, we were quite happy with the 
pours we sampled. I'd honestly say my favorite was probably the Peated Wine Cask we blind tasted 
for the Dram Club, but you couldn't go wrong with any of them. Of these two, I'd lean more toward 
the savory experience of the single malt, but I would happily have more of the California Coast, too!
