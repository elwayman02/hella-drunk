Branding themselves as "Islay's Farm Distillery", Kilchoman hosted the third 
booth at [Whiskies of the World San Francisco](/whiskies-of-the-world-2021) 
this year. With just eleven years of availability in the US, this distillery 
has already built quite a name for itself in the US scotch scene. This time 
around, they treated us to a number of their own offerings, as well as a 
great selection of other pours.

The first two bottles from Kilchoman were ones we'd tasted at past events, 
so we won't have tasting notes for them today. Even without tasting those two,
we had another six bottles at this booth! However, we can certainly speak to 
the positive experiences we've had with their 
<a href="https://bit.ly/hdmachirbaykl" target="blank">Machir Bay</a> and 
<a href="https://bit.ly/hdsanaigkl" target="blank">Sanaig</a> offerings, 
both excellent scotch expressions. 

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdkilchomansb5kl" target="blank">Kilchoman Small Batch Release No 5 Sauternes</a>

The nose from this Sauternes-finished scotch is full of peat smoke. The palate brings out 
a light amount of that peat flavor with an almond nuttiness underneath. The finish 
is surprisingly short compared to the initial strength of the nose, and it mixes that peat 
with a bit of spice as well.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdkilchomanbibkl" target="blank">Kilchoman B.I.B - Bourbon Influenced Batch</a>

Very light on the nose with notes of candied orange peel and other citrus, the scent 
of this offering also evokes thoughts of a fresh loaf or even shortbread cookies. 
The palate comes right at you with campfire smoke layered over a bit of cherry pie 
with some beautiful complexity. The long finish is chewy, really showing off the bourbon 
influence with a delightful spice.

This western highlands single malt scotch has a nice, mellow nose, ever-present with peat. 
The palate's primary notes are peat and campfire smoke, very smooth throughout. The short 
finish continues the peated experience further. While this isn't a peat monster by any means, 
it's fairly consistent and one-note throughout.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdgoudencarolustws" target="blank">Gouden Carolus Single Malt</a>

This single malt from a Belgian brewery is distilled from a Tripel-style beer of the same name. 
It's matured in first fill bourbon casks before being finished in their own beer casks, creating 
a very unique experience. The nose is quite sour, a nod to its beer influence. The palate is 
somewhat chewy and hard to place, evoking memories of a smoky taproom. The medium finish brings 
out some sweetness balanced by mild spicy to complete the experience.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdkurayoshi12tw" target="blank">Kurayoshi 12 Year</a>

This Japanese malt whisky has some ethanol on the nose, mixed with a bit of sweetness. With a 
medium-heavy mouthfeel and a bit of viscosity, the palate leans into a Scotch-like taste with 
strong notes of malted barley. The finish is medium-length with a nice cinnamon spice, rounding 
out a very good whisky overall.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdteaninich12kl" target="blank">Teaninich 12 Year 2008</a>

While not on the pour list for the event, this booth surprised us with an extra tasting from Teaninich. 
This distillery is not as well-known as its highland peers because it's more often used as a major 
component in <a href="https://bit.ly/hddrambuietw" target="blank">Drambuie</a>. This cask strength 
expression begins with a nose that evokes memories of a freshly mowed orchard mixed with a medium 
amount of ethanol vapors. The palate leads with a decent amount of peat before yielding to a long, 
hot, and spicy finish.

It's always a treat to see what Kilchoman brings to this event, and this year didn't disappoint. 
With so many offerings from their distillery alongside a wide variety of other brands, everyone was 
sure to find a favorite whisky at this booth. Personally, I was close to choosing the Teaninich 12, 
but ultimately I would go with the Kilchoman Bourbon Influenced Batch if I could only pick one. 
We can't wait to see what they bring us next year!
