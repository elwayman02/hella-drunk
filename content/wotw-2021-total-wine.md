This next edition of our [Whiskies of the World](/tag/wotw) exploration focuses on another 
major retailer that attended the San Francisco event, Total Wine & More. This year, they 
featured three bottles, one of which was The Shin 15 Year we already covered in our 
[Dram Club](/wotw-2021-dram-club) article. The two remaining whiskies were far from Japanese 
in origin, however.

Chestnut Farms is a private label bottle exclusively for Total Wine, and this high-rye bourbon is 
their core offering under that brand. It's sweet on the nose, with notes of brown sugar. The 
palate is a bit spicy, but the sweetness follows through on the nose, for a fairly smooth mouthfeel. 
The medium-short finish bring out the baking spice elements from the palate.

### <a href="https://bit.ly/hdmcfarlanestw" target="blank">McFarlane's Reserve</a>

Little is known about the origins of this newly released wheated bourbon from IJW Whiskey, which 
also appears to be carried exclusively by Total Wine, other than that it carries a 3-year age 
statement. The nose is almost sickly sweet, with notes of candied yams and gummy treats. The 
palate is dripping with caramel sweetness throughout, before giving way to a short finish with 
just a tinge of spice.

It's always interesting to see what retailers bring to an event like this; I appreciate that they 
chose bottles unique to their distribution rather than just random popular whiskies. If I had to 
pick a favorite from this booth, I'd obviously go with The Shin 15 Year, which was a very nice 
dram. I hope we continue to see retailers show off unique bottlings that establish their identity 
within the whiskey world in years to come!
