## Refreshing Summer Spotlight

This lightly golden nectar comes from scenic Helwig Winery, situated in Amador County among the 
western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The two varietals that make up this Rh√¥ne-style blend 
are almost inseparable; you rarely find Marsanne grapes used without Roussanne and vice versa, 
thanks to their complimentary characteristics. I was lucky enough to pick up half of Helwig's 
last case a few years ago as the vintage was selling out, so let's see how it tastes, shall we?

The nose starts with crisp peach and apple, with a sweet tinge almost like gummy candies. The 
palate turns more tart, bringing forth green apple in a bright, light body with medium acidity. 
The long finish turns slightly bitter, but a mild creaminess lingers underneath.

While the flavors are mostly one-note all the way through, the clean, refreshing experience 
makes up for the lack of complexity. There isn't anything too unique about this release, though 
the varietals themselves are not commonly grown in the US. Regardless, the overall experience 
is a delightful summer meal accompaniment!
