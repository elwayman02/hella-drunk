## Refreshing Summer Spotlight

This lightly golden nectar comes from scenic Helwig Winery, situated in Amador County among the 
western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The two varietals that make up this Rh√¥ne-style blend 
are almost inseparable; you rarely find Marsanne grapes used without Roussanne and vice versa, 
thanks to their complimentary characteristics. I was lucky enough to pick up half of Helwig's 
last case a few years ago as the vintage was selling out, so let's see how it tastes, shall we?

The nose starts with ripe peach and crisp, tart apple over a sweet tinge almost like gummy rings. 
The palate leans into the tartness, evoking granny smith apples in a bright, light body with 
medium acidity. The long finish turns slightly bitter, but a creaminess lingers underneath.

While the flavors are mostly one-note all the way through, the clean, refreshing experience 
makes up for the lack of complexity. The varietals themselves are not commonly grown in the US, 
so it picks up some points there for uniqueness though the wine itself is not particularly unique 
as white wines go. Regardless, the overall experience is a delightful summer meal accompaniment!
