## Our Measure of Greatness

To kick off the new Hella Drunk website, we've launched our very own rating system. 
The Hella Drunk Rating (HDR) indicates our subjective rating of each spirit we've 
tasted. We rate the spirit across five categories, then use those ratings to 
calculate a weighted overall score that indicates how we feel about the spirit. 
This score aims to give you a way to quickly compare different spirits we've rated. 
If you're interested in the deep details of HDR, you can learn more on our 
[Ratings](/page/ratings) page! If you're curious about our general thoughts on rating 
systems and why we designed our own, check out 
[Understanding Rating Systems](/page/rating-systems).

Below, you'll find an example of what a rating looks like:
