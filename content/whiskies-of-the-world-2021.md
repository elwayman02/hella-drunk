This last weekend, we were fortunate enough to attend one of our favorite whiskey events: 
Whiskies of the World! This touring event visits a bevy of different cities each year, from 
Atlanta to Seattle. Each stop features dozens of distillers and distributors showcasing premier 
whiskies from around the globe.

After skipping 2020 due to the pandemic, this was our first time back at the San Francisco event 
in two years. While normally held on the beautiful Hornblower yacht anchored at Pier 3 near the 
Ferry Building, the venue changed this year as they adapted to COVID-19 protocols. Moving north 
to Pier 27, the event was much more spacious, allowing attendees to spread out. They also split 
this year's events into two nights, reducing the crowd size at any given event. Attendees were 
required to be vaccinated and wear masks when not tasting as well.

This year featured a lot of great whiskies, and I'm sure you're curious to hear about them. Well, 
you're in luck! Over the next few weeks (or however long it takes me to write all the posts), 
Hella Drunk will be featuring tasting notes for the 100 (yes, you read that right!) different 
whiskies we tasted this year. We won't be issuing any ratings for them due to the nature of the 
event; when we taste for ratings, the process is very different from first impressions of a 
single pour on a night where dozens will be tasted.

Instead, every post will focus on a set of whiskies tasted, sharing the initial thoughts of 
our group as we tasted each one. As we took a taste of each dram, we want to share with you a 
taste of this wonderful event. We hope you enjoy this look into one of the best whiskey events 
in the United States! Learn more through their

gets published.
