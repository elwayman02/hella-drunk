# Good, But Unremarkable

Readers know from prior posts that we're fans of Cooper Vineyards here at Hella Drunk. Known 
primarily for their Barberas and Zinfandels, this family vineyard also has a number of white 
varietals on offer. Let's check this one out!

The nose gives off a light aroma, with pale notes of green apple. The palate is slightly bitter, 
layered with a citrus tang over a smooth mouthfeel. The bitterness fades slightly into the brief 
finish, leaving a crisp feeling behind.

This particular vintage is fairly straightforward, and there isn't much unique on offer here. 
However, the experience is clean and consistent throughout, making it a great wine to enjoy with 
friends or over a summer meal!
