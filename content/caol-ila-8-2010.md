# Gorgeous Islay Malt

This single malt refill hogshead from Caol Ila comes through K&L Wines' exclusive Old Particular series 
in partnership with Douglas Laing. At cask strength, we're getting a pure, unadultered expression of 
Islay malts. Let's try it out!

Fresh, pure peat permeates the nose cleanly, without a hint of ethanol. The peat mixes with the sweet 
and salty flavor of candied almonds, producing a well-balanced palate. The finish is short and slightly 
bitter, but it burns with a nice spice that leaves you wanting more.

The balance between the peat-forward exposure and other elements of this malt gives it a nice level 
of complexity, though it's still all about the peat. The overall experience is refreshingly unique while 
still evoking that classic Islay feel. If I could find a bottle, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again!
